<div class="texto">8 Simple principles to build peace in
your community
If you switch on the TV news, open the
newspaper or click onto a popular news
website, theres always news about a terrorist
attack, war, ongoing conflict and a general lack
of peace amongst different groups of people. In
an increasingly globalised world, we should
understand each other better, stand ever
more united and strive for peace. Sadly, the
truth is quite the opposite. Theres conflict in
Israel,Palestine, Kashmir, Iraq, Afghanistan,
Syria, all over the world in fact…
As individuals and citizens, how do we deal
with this? How does this relate to us? How can
we make positive changes to enable us to live
in peace?

RULE #1: TREAT OTHERS THE
WAY YOU WISH TO BE

RULE #2: LISTEN TO HEAR WHAT OTHERS HAVE
TO SAY, NOT TO SPEAK

TREATED
The good old Golden Rule says
it all: empathy, tolerance and
peace. This principle teaches
you to love yourself and love
others. It spans cultures and
faiths and is a universal age
old concept which cant fail!

Engage in dialogue with an open mind and the
real will to listen to others. Only then will you be able
to understand each other and build bridges. Change
cannot happen and peace cannot be established if
people are unable to communicate with others; to
listen to their experiences and views and show
empathy, understanding and compassion.

RULE #3: ACCEPT DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION
We all have different opinions and we may
not all agree on the same things. Building
compromise and mutual understanding is
incredibly important. Sometimes we
simply need to agree to disagree and
recognise that there are different beliefs
and forms of expression other than our
own.

RULE #4: DO NOT FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH
VIOLENCE 
Violence is never the answer. Peace can
only be brought through free will, dialogue,
empathy and forgiveness. Do not stoop to
same level as someone who is violent and
therefore continue the vicious cycle. This
does not change anything.

RULE #5: ACCEPT THAT IDENTITY IS FLUID 
Any one person can have multiple aspects to their
identity. Identity comprises many elements such as
nationality, cultural-linguistic origin, age and religious
beliefs. Identity can and does change, taking on many
new forms and means of personal expression as we
learn new languages, move home, adopt new beliefs,
marry into a different tradition and experience life! Do
not put people into a box. Avoid categorising people
according to an us vs. them narrative and remember:
we are all singular individuals with unique experiences.
Such approaches and narratives are highly divisive and
unproductive.

RULE #6: AVOID
STEREOTYPES 
Take people for the
individuals they are. Avoid
misconceptions, stereotypes
and toxic narratives and get
to know a person instead.
This will avoid offence,
misunderstandings and
ultimately help you to create
a real bond with others based
on true understanding,
empathy and trust. After all,
no one likes to be judged –
especially from the outsid

RULE #7: APPROACH THE MEDIA
WITH SKEPTICISM
Don’t just believe everything you see
on the TV, in the newspapers or on
the internet. Think objectively for
yourself. Get to know the people and
facts behind any story and don’t fall
for media scapegoating. Stand
united.

RULE #8: BE CAREFUL OF THE LANGUAGE YOU
USE
Your choice of language, alongside tone of voice
and intonation all convey a message. Make sure
that that message is positive. Be mindful of the
language you use, avoiding anything with
misogynistic, racist, Islamophobic, homophobic
or anti-Semitic overtones. Do not underestimate
the power of language – for better or for worse!
And remember, it’s not always what you say,
it’s how you say it.>
